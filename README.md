# API-final-project
Final Project for Audio Processing and Indexing

## Website
The project also has a website: https://api-final-project.vercel.app/

## Installing Requirements
- `librosa`
- `ffmpeg`

## Key and Tempo Detection
To run the key and tempo detection, open the "BPM and Key Detection.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook and just run all. You will need librosa installed. Also required to have ffmpeg installed so that `audioread` can read `.mp3` files.

## Music Transcription
The notebook "Automatic Music Transcription.ipynb" is a slightly modified version of the example notebook which can be found on https://music-and-culture-technology-lab.github.io/omnizart-doc/quick-start.html. As the original notebook is run in Google Colab, our implementation should also be run in Google Colab.
